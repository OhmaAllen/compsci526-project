- **Mean BP (vital)**: 1.2% coverage
- **Diastolic BP (vital)**: 1.2% coverage

- **SpO2 (vital)**: 1.2% coverage
- **Temperature (vital)**: 1.1% coverage

## üîç Critical Insights

### 1. **Lab Values are Reliable, Vitals are NOT**
- **Lab values**: 76-78% of admissions have measurements
- **Vital signs**: Only 1-2% coverage in our cohort
- **Reason**: Our cohort includes general ward patients, not just ICU
  - Vital signs (chartevents) are primarily recorded in ICU
  - Lab values are collected across all hospital units

### 2. **Measurement Density is Good**
- When labs are available, median = 2 measurements per patient in 48h window
- This is reasonable for a 48-hour window
- Some patients have many more (mean ‚âà 1.8-1.9)

### 3. **Missing Value Quality**
- When measurements exist, missing rate is **<0.5%** (excellent!)
- Missing data is primarily due to **not ordering the test**, not measurement failures

## üéØ Recommendations for Feature Engineering

### Use These Features (High Quality):
```python
USABLE_LABS = [
    'creatinine',      # Kidney function (78.4%)
    'potassium',       # Electrolyte (78.1%)
    'bun',             # Kidney function (78.0%)
    'platelets',       # Coagulation (77.8%)
    'sodium',          # Electrolyte (77.7%)
    'chloride',        # Electrolyte (77.6%)
    'hemoglobin',      # Anemia marker (77.5%)
    'wbc',             # Infection marker (77.5%)
    'bicarbonate',     # Acid-base (76.9%)
    'anion_gap',       # Metabolic status (76.9%)
    'glucose'          # Diabetes/metabolic (76.6%)
]
```

### Handle Specially:
- **Lactate**: Only use as a binary indicator ("had_lactate_measured")
  - When measured, often indicates severe illness
  - Can be a powerful feature despite sparsity

### Exclude from Time-Series:
- All vital signs (heart_rate, BP, RR, SpO2, temp)
- Coverage too low (<2%) to be useful as time-series features
- **Alternative**: Try using ICU stays only, or use static aggregates if available

---

## üìà Revised Feature Strategy

### Option A: Lab-Only Model (Recommended)
```
Features:
- 11 lab values (time-series, last 48h)
- Static demographics (age, gender)
- Comorbidity scores (Charlson)
- Admission characteristics (LOS, admission_type)
- Binary flag: had_lactate_measured

Expected performance: Good
Advantage: High data quality, fewer missing values
```

### Option B: ICU-Focused Model
```
Restrict cohort to:
- Patients with ICU stays only
- This would increase vital signs coverage

Trade-off:
- Smaller cohort (maybe 50,000-100,000 admissions)
- Better vital signs data
- Less generalizable to general ward patients
```

### Option C: Hybrid Model (Aspirational)
```
- Use lab values as primary time-series features
- Add vital signs where available (with heavy masking)
- Use mask-aware models (GRU-D, Transformer with attention masks)

Challenge: Requires sophisticated missing data handling
```

## üö® Important Notes for Next Steps

### 1. Revise config.yaml
The current config includes vital signs, but we now know they're not usable:

```yaml
# BEFORE (in config.yaml):
vitals:
  - name: "heart_rate"
    itemids: [220045]
  # ... more vitals

# RECOMMENDATION: Comment out or remove vitals
# OR: Add a flag to skip them in feature extraction
```

### 2. Update Feature Extraction Script (Step 4)
- Focus on **lab values only**
- Add special handling for **lactate** (binary flag)
- Skip vital signs extraction (or make it optional)
- Implement mask-aware tensors for 20-30% missing labs

### 3. Consider Cohort Refinement
**Question to decide:**
- Keep general ward patients (current: 225,323 admissions, no vitals)
- OR restrict to ICU stays (smaller N, but with vitals)?

**My recommendation:** Keep general ward, use labs only. This is more clinically relevant for 30-day readmission prediction.

## üìä Performance Expectations

Based on coverage analysis:

| Feature Set | Expected Performance | Data Quality | Cohort Size |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Labs only** | AUROC 0.72-0.78 | Excellent | 225,323 ‚úì |
| Labs + Vitals (all) | AUROC 0.70-0.75 | Poor (vitals <2%) | 225,323 |
| ICU + Labs + Vitals | AUROC 0.75-0.80 | Good | ~50,000-100,000 |

**Recommendation:** Go with **Labs only** first, then consider ICU cohort as sensitivity analysis.
