### Step 2: Label Generation ✓
**Script:** `02_label_generation.py`  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE AND VALIDATED**

**Results:**
- **Total admissions:** 403,677

- **Invalid labels:** 178,354 (last admission per patient - no follow-up)

**Readmission Statistics:**
- **Overall readmission rate:** 17.5% (across all admissions)
- **Among valid labels:** 31.3% readmitted ✓
- **Not readmitted:** 68.7% ✓

**Time to Readmission:**
- Mean: 11.6 days
- Median: 10.1 days
- 25th percentile: 4.3 days
- 75th percentile: 18.0 days

**Outputs:** 
- `mimic_data/processed_data/readmission_labels.csv` (all admissions)
- `mimic_data/processed_data/readmission_labels_valid.csv` (only valid labels for modeling)

## ⏳ Next Steps

### Step 3: Missingness Report
**Script:** `03_missingness_report.py`  
**Status:** ⏳ Ready to run

**What it will do:**
- Analyze coverage of vital signs (chartevents)
- Analyze coverage of lab values (labevents)
- Generate missingness statistics per feature
- Create visualizations
- Identify which features are usable (>50% coverage)

**Expected runtime:** 10-20 minutes (samples 10,000 admissions)

**Run command:**
```bash
cd /Users/yuchenzhou/Documents/duke/compsci526/final_proj/git_proj/yuchen_testing/yuchen_testing_10.19/src/data
python 03_missingness_report.py
```

---

### Step 4: Feature Extraction (TODO)
**Script:** `04_feature_extraction.py` - **NEEDS TO BE CREATED**

**Requirements:**
- Extract time-series from chartevents (vitals) and labevents (labs)
- Window: Last 48 hours before discharge
- Temporal binning: Hourly (48 bins)
- Features:
  - Vitals: HR, SBP, DBP, RR, SpO2, Temp
  - Labs: WBC, Hgb, Plt, Na, K, Cr, BUN, Glucose, Lactate
- Output: NPZ files per admission with mask tensors

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours to implement  
**Estimated runtime:** 30-90 minutes to process all admissions

---

### Step 5: Static Features (TODO)
**Script:** `05_static_features.py` - **NEEDS TO BE CREATED**

**Requirements:**
- Demographics: age, gender
- Comorbidity scores: Charlson Comorbidity Index
- Admission features: admission_type, LOS
- Output: `static_features.csv`

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours to implement

---

### Step 6: Train/Val/Test Split (TODO)
**Script:** `06_train_val_test_split.py` - **NEEDS TO BE CREATED**

**Requirements:**
- Patient-level split (no leakage)
- Proportions: 70% train, 15% val, 15% test
- Stratified by readmission label
- Output: Three text files with hadm_id lists

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 hours to implement

## 📊 Data Quality Validation

### ✅ Checklist (2/7 complete)

- [x] **Cohort size reasonable:** 225,323 valid admissions ✓
- [x] **Readmission rate in expected range:** 31.3% ✓ (typically 15-35% in acute care)
- [ ] **Key features have >50% coverage** - Need to run Step 3
- [ ] **Time-series tensors created** - Need to implement Step 4
- [ ] **Static features with comorbidity scores** - Need to implement Step 5
- [ ] **Train/val/test split exists** - Need to implement Step 6
- [ ] **No patient leakage between splits** - Will validate in Step 6

## 🐛 Known Issues

### NumPy Compatibility Warning
**Issue:** You're seeing NumPy 1.x vs 2.x compatibility warnings

**Impact:** Scripts still run successfully, but warnings are annoying

**Solution (Optional):** Reinstall packages in a clean environment:
```bash
# Option 1: Create new conda environment
conda create -n readmit_clean python=3.11 -y
conda activate readmit_clean
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn pyyaml matplotlib seaborn tqdm

# Option 2: Just ignore the warnings - scripts work fine!
```

**Note:** The warnings don't affect functionality - both scripts completed successfully!

## 📈 Next Recommended Actions

### Immediate (This Week):

1. **Run Step 3:** Missingness analysis
   ```bash
   python 03_missingness_report.py
   ```
   This will tell you which features are usable (>50% coverage)

2. **Review missingness results** before implementing feature extraction
   - This will inform which features to include
   - May discover some labs/vitals are too sparse to use

3. **Plan feature extraction strategy** based on missingness report

### This Week's Goals:

- [ ] Complete missingness analysis (Step 3)
- [ ] Review missingness report and decide on feature set
- [ ] Implement feature extraction script (Step 4)
- [ ] Implement static features script (Step 5)
- [ ] Implement train/test split (Step 6)
- [ ] **Goal:** Have all data processing complete by end of week
