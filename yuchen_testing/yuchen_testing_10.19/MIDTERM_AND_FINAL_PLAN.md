## üöÄ PLANNED: Second Half (Final Report)

### Option 1: Causal Inference on Early Discharge ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Research Question:**
> "What is the causal effect of early discharge (LOS < 3 days) on 30-day readmission risk?"

**Why This is Excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Policy-relevant (hospitals pressured to discharge early for cost savings)
- ‚úÖ Clear intervention (discharge timing)
- ‚úÖ Measurable confounders (severity via Charlson, labs, age)
- ‚úÖ You already have the data (LOS is a feature)

**Methods:**
1. **Propensity Score Matching**
   - Match early vs normal discharge patients by severity
   - Balance confounders: Charlson score, lab abnormalities, age, diagnoses
   
2. **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)**
   - Reweight observations to remove confounding
   
3. **Doubly Robust Estimation**
   - Combine PS matching + outcome modeling for robustness
   
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - Test for unmeasured confounding (Rosenbaum bounds)

**Causal DAG:**
```
Patient Severity ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Early Discharge ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Readmission
      ‚Üì                                       ‚Üë
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
           (Confounding path to block)
```

**Expected Result:**
> "After adjusting for patient severity, early discharge (LOS < 3 days) causes an 8% absolute increase in 30-day readmission risk (95% CI: 5-11%, p<0.001), suggesting hospitals should carefully evaluate discharge timing decisions."

**Tools:**
```python
# Use Microsoft's DoWhy library
import dowhy

model = dowhy.CausalModel(
    data=df,
    treatment='early_discharge',  # LOS < 3 days
    outcome='readmit_30d',
    common_causes=['charlson_score', 'age', 'num_diagnoses', 'lab_severity']
)

# Identify & estimate causal effect
identified = model.identify_effect()
estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified, method_name="backdoor.propensity_score_matching")

# Sensitivity analysis
refute = model.refute_estimate(identified, estimate, method_name="random_common_cause")
```

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Propensity score estimation and matching
- Week 2: IPW and doubly robust estimation
- Week 3: Sensitivity analysis and visualization
- Week 4: Writing and integration with midterm work

---

### Option 2: Feature Importance ‚Üí Causal Effects

**Research Question:**
> "Does declining hemoglobin trend causally predict readmission, or is it just association?"

**Methods:**
- Granger causality testing
- Structural causal models
- Mediation analysis

**Why Less Ideal:**
- Harder to define clear intervention
- More complex causal assumptions
- Less policy-relevant

---

### Option 3: Causal Fairness Analysis

**Research Question:**
> "Do racial disparities in readmission predictions arise from causal pathways through access to care?"

**Methods:**
- Path-specific effects
- Counterfactual fairness
- Causal mediation analysis

**Why Interesting But Challenging:**
- High impact (healthcare equity)
- Complex causal graphs
- Need race/ethnicity data (available in MIMIC-IV)
- Sensitive ethical considerations

- Causation: Early discharge causes +8% readmission risk
- Temporal patterns: Rising creatinine, declining hemoglobin predict readmissions

### Discussion
- Temporal modeling adds significant value (+0.12 AUROC)
- Early discharge causal effect has policy implications
- Implementation: Risk stratification + discharge timing optimization

### Conclusion
- Both predictive and causal insights for reducing readmissions
- Future work: Prospective validation, intervention trials
